# FaceFocusVR

  + FaceFocusVR is a project I developed to offer a clean and plug-and-play solution for retrofitting eye and face tracking to existing VR headsets. This project focuses exclusively on the hardware. The software I use for eye and face tracking is open-source and linked below. Currently, the hardware is only available for the Valve Index, but additional headsets may be supported in the future depending on demand.
