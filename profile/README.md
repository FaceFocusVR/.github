# FaceFocusVR

FaceFocusVR is a project I developed to offer a clean plug-and-play solution for retrofitting eye and face tracking to existing VR headsets.
The project focuses exclusively on the hardware, while the open-source software for eye and face tracking is linked below.
Currently, the hardware is only available for the Valve Index, but additional headsets may be supported in the future depending on demand.
