# FaceFocusVR

FaceFocusVR is a project I developed to provide a more seamless, „plug-and-play“ solution for retrofitting eye and face tracking to existing VR headsets.

While FaceFocusVR focuses exclusively on the hardware, I use proven open-source software for eye and face tracking, which is linked below. Currently, the hardware is available only for the Valve Index, but additional headsets may be supported in the future based on demand.

My goal with this project is to encourage the broader adoption of face and especially eye tracking. In my view, both technologies hold incredible potential – from enhancing social VR experiences to enabling techniques like foveated rendering (unfortunately not supported at this time).
