# HOW TO BUY

There are two ways to get FaceFocusVR hardware.
<br/><br/>

## DIY:
  + Since the FaceFocusVR project is open-source, I have released all the files for the PCBs, as well as all the schematics, 3D parts, and everything else related to the project.
  + Since the PCBs are very complex, the only realistic way to obtain them is to have them assembled by a PCBA service from JLCPCB or a similar provider.
