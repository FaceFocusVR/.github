# Safety

No system is 100% secure, but Iâ€™ve done everything possible to protect both the hardware where the mainboard is installed, the mainboard itself, and of course, your eyes.

Do not attempt to replace, repair, or disable any safety-related circuits or components yourself! Although we are exposed to infrared radiation daily, it can be harmful in excessive doses!

Even though I check each IR LED on kits that i sell, the risk of use lies with the user. The safety measures are designed to REDUCE potential failure risks, but all further safety responsibilities fall on the user. This includes ensuring you do not feel warmth, excessive eye strain, or experience short-term effects like dark spots or dry/warm eyes during use.

I have tried to make FaceFokusVR as safe as possible, but I do not take responsibility for any damage incurred.

## IR-LED Safety
  + In this section, I will focus on the infrared LEDs that illuminate the eyes. The illumination of the face is controlled by the same system; however, the current passing through the LEDs is higher, as there is no risk to the eyes.

  + The safety measures and calculations are primarily based on the guidelines provided by the EYETrackVr team. However, I have independently verified and expanded upon these measures, offering a more detailed explanation of the protective measures implemented to meet the requirements. You can find the safety guidelines from the EYETrackVr team here: [IR Emitter Safety / EyeTrackVR](https://docs.eyetrackvr.dev/getting_started/led_safety)
