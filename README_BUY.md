# How to get FaceFocusVR
There are two ways to get FaceFocusVR hardware.
<br/><br/>

## 1. Buy:
  + The easiest way is to purchase a kit from my shop. Since I order in larger quantities, this is also (for most) the way cheaper option.
  + In about 1-2 months, there will also be an option to purchase all the components individually.
  + [Shop](TBD)

### Limitation:
  + Currently, I can only offer shipping within the EU, as international shipping requires more preparation (such as customs handling). This will likely change in the future, but I can't make any promises at the         moment.
  + Here is a link to a survey to see the interest in international shipping. Please only participate if you have a genuine interest.
  + [Survey](TBD)

## 2. DIY:
  + The FaceFocusVR project is open-source, therefore I have released all  files for the PCBs, as well as all the schematics, 3D parts, production files and everything else related to the project.
  + Since the PCBs are very complex, the only realistic way to obtain them is to have them assembled by a PCBA service. I use JLCPCB.
